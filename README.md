### Welcome!

I am an Irish student who likes programming and playing games in his free time.

I like to work on various hardware and software projects, from Arduino to SwiftUI apps.
## Here are (some of) my current works:
* [f1-24-udp](https://github.com/MacManley/f1-24-udp) - F1 24 UDP Telemetry Parser library for the Arduino Toolchain, mainly for ESP32 / ESP8266
* [gt7-udp](https://github.com/MacManley/gt7-udp) - Gran Turismo 7 UDP Telemetry Parser for the Arduino Toolchain, mainly for ESP32 / ESP8266
