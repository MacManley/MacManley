### Welcome!

I am an Irish student who likes programming and playing games in his free time.

I have recently been working on UDP Telemetry parsers for video games that work on the ESP32 / ESP8266. I also have been making SwiftUI Apps
## Here are my current works, and ones I plan to release soon:
* [f1-23-udp](https://github.com/MacManley/f1-23-udp) - F1 23 UDP Telemetry Parser library for the Arduino Toolchain, mainly for ESP32 / ESP8266
* [project-cars-2-udp](https://github.com/MacManley/project-cars-2-udp) - Project Cars 2 UDP Telemetry Parser library for the Arduino Toolchain, mainly for ESP32 / ESP8266
* [gt7-udp](https://github.com/MacManley/gt7-udp) - Gran Turismo 7 UDP Telemetry Parser for the Arduino Toolchain, mainly for ESP32 / ESP8266
* I may also branch out beyond Parsers in the future, stay tuned!
