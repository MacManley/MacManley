### Welcome!

I am a student who likes programming in his free time.

I have recently been working on UDP Telemetry parsers for video games that work on the ESP32 / ESP8266. I also have been making SwiftUI Apps
## Here are my current works, and ones I plan to release soon:
* [f1udp-esp](https://github.com/MacManley/f1udp_esp) - F1 23 Telemetry Parser library for Arduino Toolchain, mainly for ESP32 / ESP8266
* I am also working on Telemetry Parsers for use on the ESP32 / ESP8266 for PCars2 and Gran Turismo 7. I may also branch out beyond this in the future, stay tuned!
