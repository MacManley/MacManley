### Welcome!

I am an Irish student who likes programming and playing games in his free time.

I have recently been working on UDP Telemetry parsers for video games that work on the ESP32 / ESP8266. I also have been making SwiftUI Apps
## Here are my current works, and ones I plan to release soon:
* [f1udp-esp](https://github.com/MacManley/f1udp_esp) - F1 23 UDP Telemetry Parser library for the Arduino Toolchain, mainly for ESP32 / ESP8266
* [pcars2udp-esp](https://github.com/MacManley/pcars2udp_esp) - Project Cars 2 UDP Telemetry Parser library for the Arduino Toolchain, mainly for ESP32 / ESP8266
* [gt7-udp-esp](https://github.com/MacManley/gt7_udp_esp) - Gran Turismo 7 UDP Telemetry Parser for the Arduino Toolchain, mainly for ESP32 / ESP8266
* I may also branch out beyond Parsers in the future, stay tuned!
